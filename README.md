The first example of course that we plan to develop will be
with scolarships for the people of Sierra Leone.

It will receive coins from the fund for christian missions
"Hands for Sierra Leone" whose wallet in mainnet is

(And in testnet it is EQBW-VzrrQgUZCKonQm3gHqDFUK42yM33k3g6zMpvvq7tcCj )

The project "Intercambiador COP - TON"
<https://github.com/pasosdeJesus/intercambiador> gives part of its profit 
to that fund.

For this reason and because this project was accepted for DoraHacks only
on 13th March 2023 --although we submitted it in January-- we have 
been advancing in "Intercambiador COP - TON" instead and we apologize
for not having code here in the moment of this writing and we commit to
submit soon.
